2nd Semester Business Application using the concepts of OOP

This project represents the culmination of our second-semester Object-Oriented Programming course. Building upon the foundation of our first-semester Business Application, I've transformed the initial concept. The evolution involved a transition from a console-based interface to a more user-friendly graphical interface developed using Windows Forms in C#. This application underscores the application of core Object-Oriented Programming principles, which enhance code structure and maintainability.
